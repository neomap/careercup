Collect hints from others and mine
===================================
### From someone's [interview experience for Google][1]

- Clarify the question – make sure you understand everything.

- Try to find the most efficient solution.

- Come up with solutions quickly: even if its a brute force solution. Always iterate away from the original solution.

- Before you start coding explain why you’re approaching it that way ,its ok to start off with a naive solution and try to make it more efficient.

- Explain the rationale behind the steps you are doing.

- Think out loud, keep things technical. The engineers will give you hints: take a hint! They are there to help you!

- Always write “compilable” code.

- Mind edge cases. Find bugs in your code.
